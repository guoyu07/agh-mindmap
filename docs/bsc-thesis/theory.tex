\section{The representation of mind maps and XMind files}
\label{sec:xmind}

Mind maps are proved to be one of the best ways of organising ideas, brainstorming and dealing with information overload. The research conducted by a Nobel prize winning scientist Dr. Roger Sperry shows that the activities which integrate the functions of two brain hemispheres are the most effective~\cite{Voneida:1998:Sperry}. Left hemisphere is responsible for logical thinking, writing, analysing and details, while the right one for imagination, colors, spatial memory, recognizing shapes and seeing the whole picture. He has also proved that when one hemisphere is overloaded, the second `falls asleep.' So, in order to work efficiently, one must engage both hemispheres as neither pure logic, nor sole creativity would `do the trick.' Mindmapping uses a whole variety of activities associated with both hemispheres, thus enhancing overall effectiveness and productivity.

A single mind map consists of nodes and edges. The most important part of the map is its central idea, the root node. Along with the development of a map, more subnodes can be added, creating relationships between each other: a connected, nodal structure. Also, there can be floating nodes (which are not connected with any of other nodes) or links between any two nodes (relations). A single node's content is usually text, it can also have other attributes like color,  icon and attachment.

There are many available programs for mindmapping. Among commercial solutions, the most popular software is {\em Mindjet MindManager} and {\em iMindMap}. Free software includes {\em XMind}, {\em FreeMind} and \emph{MindMeister}~\cite{Wiki:Software}. There is also a number of web applications: \emph{MindMeister.com}, \emph{bubbl.us}. However, the basis for our representation of a mind map is an open source tool, {\em XMind}.

XMind files (`workbooks') are saved as a ZIP archive of mostly \inlinecode{.xml} files. Two of them are the most important and always present. First, \inlinecode{content.xml} stores the actual data and its hierarchy. The second, \inlinecode{META-INF/manifest.xml} is the list of files included in the archive. An {\em XMind} file could also contain separate \inlinecode{.xml} documents for content and styles, a \inlinecode{.jpg} image file for thumbnails, and directories for related attachments~\cite{XMind:2009:Format}. In our application, we will implement importing and exporting these {\em XMind} files.)

\section{Android application}
\label{sec:android-theory}

Android is a Linux system in which each application is run as a different user. Every Android application runs in isolation from others, as a separate Linux process with its own virtual machine ({\em Dalvik}), thus implementing the principle of least privilege. Obviously, there are ways to communicate with other applications or device features (like camera, extra storage, Bluetooth etc.). In fact, it is considered to be unique for Android architecture that every application can start an activity of other application (as long as this other application's activity is marked as externally `startable' in its \inlinecode{AndroidManifest.xml})~\cite{Collins:Android}.

Every Android application is built using four basic types of components: activities (with fragments), services, content providers, and broadcast receivers, each having its own lifecycle which defines how the component is created and destroyed (among others).

\begin{itemize}
	\item An activity is usually described as a single `screen' with a user interface. An application consists of many activities which are more or less independent from each other.
	\item A service runs in the background, within the main thread. It can be started by another component which then could bind-in to it, thus communicating with it.
	\item A content provider deals with application's data, it encapsulates the data and provides an API for managing it.
	\item A broadcast receiver listens and responds to system messages and notifications.
\end{itemize}

All types of components except content providers can be activated by an asynchronous message called `intent.' A content provider is activated by a request from a \inlinecode{ContentResolver}.

In order to start an application, Android system must know its components in the \inlinecode{AndroidManifest.xml} file. It takes care of a number of things: it declares API version information (supported version(s) of Android system), hardware requirements and other libraries from outside the SDK which are used in the application. An Android SDK generally uses quite a lot of \inlinecode{.xml} files. It provides reusable layouts with a detailed declaration of the user interface and creates a handy way of declaring resources used in the application.
