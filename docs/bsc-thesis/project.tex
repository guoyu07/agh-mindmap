\subsection{Data representation}
\label{subsec:data-repr}

Mind maps edited in our software will be kept in a database which consists of two tables. \todo{Entities diagram of the DB}One represents a mind map with a UUID, and the other --- a single node which has the following fields: UUID, its mind map UUID, content, parent (which keeps UUID of a parent node), \todo{timestamp \& conflict are hard to understand just from this}timestamp of the last modification (provided by server, this is not a local time) and a flag which says whether there's a conflict in the content of this node. The fact that a single node remembers only its parent may  cause a number of problems with conflicts in which one user deletes (online) a whole branch and other modifies its nodes offline. However, it also makes database store no excess data.

\subsection{Collaboration}
\label{subsec:collaboration}

The most challenging part of the \todo{can we use `thesis' as an alias for `paper'/`implementation'?}thesis is implementing online collaboration and synchronisation of a map when one of contributors lost the Internet connection.
