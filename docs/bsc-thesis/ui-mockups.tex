\subsection{User interface mock-ups}
\label{subsec:ui-mockups}

\Cref{fig:mockup-maplist} below show a \emph{mock-up} (a sketch) of the main, initial screen of the Android application. The user can:

\begin{itemize}
	\item choose an existing map to edit,
	\item select and delete a map by long-pressing it,
	\item add a new map,
	\item import an existing XMind map,
	\item switch to any other opened map by means of tabs at the top.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]

	\missingfigure{\michal{K., list view mock-up}}
	\caption{Mock-up of mind map list, initial screen.}
	\label{fig:mockup-maplist}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:mockup-mindmap} shows a similar preview of a map view: a screen that is shown to the user when he chooses/adds/imports a map in \cref{fig:mockup-maplist}. Here, the user can:

\begin{itemize}
	\item edit content of any `mind node' by tapping on it,
	\item remove any node (and its subtree) by long-pressing it and selecting `remove',
	\item move any node (reassign its parent node) by long-pressing it and selecting `change parent', and then tapping on the new parent,
	\item add a child node to any node by tapping on `+' button next to the parent node,
	\item see (in real-time) changes introduced by other editors currently editing this map.
\end{itemize}
