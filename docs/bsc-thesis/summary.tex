\section{How does the implementation solve the problem?}
\label{summary-how-solve}
\todo[inline]{How does the implementation solve the problem?}
\todo[inline]{Remind about the objective.}
The aims of our work are put in \cref{sec:requirements}. Now we will sum up what we managed to implement. 
 
The first objective was to create an application compatible with XMind which lets its users create, edit and display mind maps. We succeeded in this task: our application enables creating, editing, displaying and deleting mind maps.

Next, there was a part about presenting maps in a clean, structured way. We believe our application meets tis requirement. We put a lot of effort in positioning mind nodes, bidirectional scroll view also turned out to be troublesome and it is described in the \cref{sec:impl-problems}.

\section{What is missing in our solution?}
\label{summary-missing}
\todo[inline]{Were all problems solved? If not: why?}
The Android application is visually compatibile with XMind only on a very basic level. The main reason for that is that that was not the main issue while creating the software. We wanted to focus on creating the \emph{collaboration} tool. Still, a better compatibility would definitely be beneficial. 

When it comes to the UI, we did not implement subtree folding, which seems a basic functionality in mind mapping software (althought not mentioned in our requirements). Also, the feature of moving any node (reassigning its parent node) by long-pressing it and choosing 'Change parent' option, and then tapping on the new parent-to-be was not implemented. At that point, there was not enough time left to add it.

\section{Future works}
\label{summary-future}
When it comes to what could be done next, some of the things we would like to see implemented include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item better XMind compatibility, support for node--node relations, folding, floating objects and attachments, custom icons, as well as some predefined styles,
\end{itemize}

\todo[inline]{\michal{web application using only static HTML/JS/CSS files (and the same highly-scalable Akka as a backend)}}
\todo[inline]{\michal{move Akka's storage to NoSQL}}
\todo[inline]{\michal{involve a professional designer to draw all UI elements}}
\todo[inline]{\michal{make use of akka-cluster project}}
\todo[inline]{\michal{add map-wide blocking of currently-edited node (for other, non-editing users)}}
