\section{Scala}
\label{sec:scala}

Our language of choice for this system (for both client- and server-side) is Scala: a multi-paradigm, object-functional programming language. It compiles to Java bytecode, so it offers full compatibility with Android SDK, at the same time making the code unmeasureably more elegant and robust~\cite{Odersky:2008:Programming}.

\section{Akka.io for server-side}
\label{sec:akka}

Akka is an actor model for Scala (and Java) languages: `a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed, and fault tolerant event-driven applications on the JVM'~\cite{Akka:2013:Docs}. Actor model is a higher-level abstraction of concurrent programming. All operations are performed in a non-blocking fashion. Any number of servers can form one (or more) big actor cluster. Each actor is a very lightweight event-driven process; this makes it possible to create approximately 2.7 million actors per 1 GB of heap memory~\cite{Akka:2013:Docs}.

Actors can be thought of as concurrent processes which communicate by passing messages. At the same time they are really efficient: especially 1 actor is \emph{not} equivalent to 1 thread, and \emph{not even 1} lightweight JVM thread.
