\todo{No, co tutaj, to no freakin' idea. o\_O}

\todo{Co się udało, co się nie udało!}

\todo{Future works z pracy:{\tiny\tiny\begin{itemize}
		\item adding users, privileges, explicit sharing etc. (the most important feature the system is now lacking),
		\item subtree folding,
		\item copy/paste operations on nodes and their subtrees,
		\item zoom,
		\item better XMind compatibility, support for node--node relations, folding, floating objects and attachments, custom icons, as well as some predefined styles,
		\item a web application using only static HTML/JS/CSS files (and, what's most important, \emph{the same} highly-scalable Akka as a backend),
		\item a move of Akka's storage from PostgreSQL to a more scalable NoSQL store (probably MongoDB),
		\item an involvement of a professional UI designer; having him draw all UI elements would add to a beautiful user experience,
		\item making use of a new \inlinecode{akka-cluster} Akka subproject to have no central/main Akka node; instead, a completely self-organizing cluster of servers would be more fault-tolerant,
		\item adding map-wide blocking of currently-edited node for other, non-editing users to improve the UX even more.
	\end{itemize}}}
