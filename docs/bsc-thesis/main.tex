\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}
TODO: Remove headlines (after having written the introduction - it must contain all 5 modules). 
\section{What? The problem}
\label{sec:what}
Mind maps are diagrams which visually gather ideas and put them in a logical structure. It usually consists of one or more central words, around which are placed associated ideas and concepts. Sub--branches may also represent categories.  They are used in a whole range of disciplines, both in science and arts for both commercial and personal use. They are proved to be one of the best ways of organising ideas, brainstorming and dealing with information overload. The research conducted by a Nobel prize winning scientist Dr. Roger Sperry shows that the activities which integrate the functions of two brain hemispheres are the most effective. Left hemisphere is responsible for logical thinking, writing, analysing and details, while the right one - for imagination, colors, spatial memory, recognizing shapes and seeing the whole picture. He also proved that when one hemisphere is overloaded, the second 'falls asleep'. So in order to work efficiently, one must engage both hemispheres -- neither pure logic nor sole creativity would do the trick. Mindmapping uses a whole variety of activities associated with both hemispheres, thus enhancing overall effectiveness and productivity. 

\section{How? Shortly about the method}
\label{sec:how}
The subject of the thesis is project and implementation of a mind-mapping tool for Android. It should support data exchange with one of the most popular software, XMind, as well as saving data as an image or a PDF. Also, it should provide tools for collaboration -- working on the same map by more than one person. The task may be divided into two modules. First is creating an Android application, which supports XMind files. It will be implemented using Scala and Android SDK. Second part of the task is including collaboration tool for many users. To achieve this, we are going to use Lift -- a free web framework  designed for Scala. Collaboration should be implemented by setting a limitation: one leaf can be edited by only one person at a time. After a time of idleness, editing should be disabled.

\section{Why? The source}
\label{sec:why}
Mind-mapping tools are becoming more and more popular these days. At this point, there is a shortage of an Android mind--mapping tools, while the number of devices operating on Android is growing rapidly. 

\section{What for? Consequences}
\label{sec:whatfor}
Mind--mapping tools are used in a whole range of disciplines, both in science and arts. They are proved to be a very effective way of organising ideas, brainstorming and dealing with information overload. Considering the fact that tablets and mobile phones are nowadays a natural way of recording notes and ideas for most people, creating an application which makes the process of collecting and organising ideas intuitive and effective seems an important task.

\section{What's in next chapters?}
\label{sec:nextchapters}
Next chapters include the theoretical analysis of the problem and detailed description of the possible solution. Then, we will discuss the implementation details. In the final part we will focus on the analysis of our solution, providing tests to check how many of the initial problems were solved by the application.

\chapter{Theoretical basis}
\label{chap:theory}

\section{The representation of mind maps and XMind files}
\label{sec:xmind}
A single mind map starts with a blank sheet, which is then filled with data. The most important part of a map is the central idea, the root topic.  Along with the development of a map more subtopics can be added, creating relationships between each other, a connected, nodal structure. The basis for the representation of a mind map is an open source tool, XMind. 
XMind files (workbooks) are saved as an archive of mostly .xml files, of which two are the most important and required to save a map. First, \inlinecode{content.xml} stored data and its hierarchy, and the second, \inlinecode{META-INF/manifest.xml} being the list of files included in the archive. An XMind file could also contain separate .xml documents for content and styles, a .jpg image file for thumbnails, and directories for related attachments.

\section{Android application}
\label{androidsdk}
Android operating system is a Linux system in which each application is a different user. Every Android application is built using four basic components: activities, services, content providers, and broadcast receivers. 

\section{Lift server and collaboration}
\label{lift}
In this project, Lift web framework is used only as a backend for the mobile application that enables all mobile devices with the app installed to share maps and collaborate on them. Several REST web services are implemented; these are internally (server-side) asynchronously managed by a pile of very light-weight Scala actors. Each connected mobile device gets its own actor and instant bidirectional communication between devices is achieved by means of long-polling: mobile app initiates a connection with a REST service which does not respond until its actor receives a message from another actor.
