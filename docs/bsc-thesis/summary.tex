\section{How does the implementation solve the problem?}
\label{summary-how-solve}
\todo[inline]{How does the implementation solve the problem?}
\todo[inline]{Remind about the objective.}
The aims of this thesis are put in \cref{sec:requirements}. Now we will sum up what we managed to implement. 
 
The first objective was to create an application compatible with XMind which lets its users create, edit and display mind maps. We succeeded in this task - out application enables creating, editing, displaying and deleting mind maps. 

Next, there was a part about presenting maps in a clean, structured way. We believe our application meets tis requirement. We put a lot of effort in positioning mind nodes, bidirectional scroll view also turned out to be troublesome and it is described in the \cref{sec:impl-problems}

\section{What is missing in our solution?}
\label{summary-missing}
\todo[inline]{Were all problems solved? If not: why?}
The Android application implements compatibility with XMind on a basic level. The main reason for that is that that was not the main issue while creating the software -- we wanted to focus on creating the collaboration tool, but a better compatibility would be beneficial. 

When it comes to the UI, we did not implement subtree wrapping, which seems a basic functionality in mind mapping software (althought not mentioned in our requirements). Also, the feature of moving any node (reassigning its parent node) by long-pressing it and selecting 'change parent', and then tapping on the new parent was not written. At this point, there was not enough time to add it.

\section{Future works}
\label{summary-future}
\todo[inline]{Future works}
When it comes to the XMind compatibility, a things to implement next would be a support for relations, floating objects and appendices, as well as styles settings.
