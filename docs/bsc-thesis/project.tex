\section{Requirements}
\label{sec:requirements}

\todo[inline]{What else goes here?\ldots}

As this is a proof-of-concept system, no user privileges will be implemented (although these would be easy to add, considering highly modular and clean organization of code). Thus, any device will be able to modify any existing map.

\section{Planned solution}
\label{sec:plan}

Our application allows its users to edit maps collaboratively, either over the Internet in real time, or offline with later online synchronization. This system consists of two main components:

\begin{itemize}
	\item an Android application running on any number of Android powered devices,
	\item and a cluster of any number of servers running a distributed, highly parallelized Akka actor system with a REST interface.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Component: Android application}
\label{subsec:component-android}

\todo[inline]{Project Android: what subcomponents? (Own and from system library!)}

\subsection{Component: Akka.io application}
\label{subsec:component-akka}

\todo[inline]{Project Akka: what subcomponents? (Own and from library!)}

Akka is used as a backend for the mobile application. It enables all mobile devices with the application installed to share maps and collaborate on them in real-time. Several REST web services are implemented using Spray.io (a REST interface to Akka) for communication between Android devices and actor system on the server-side.

Each REST-connected mobile device gets its own actor. Instant bidirectional communication between devices is achieved by means of `long-polling': mobile app initiates a connection with a REST service which does not respond until its actor receives a message from another actor.

See \cref{subsec:android-akka-comm} for details about Android--Akka communication protocol.

\todo[inline]{What messages do the actors \emph{within} the system exchange?}

\todo[inline]{How does Akka communicate with Postgres?}

\subsection{Data representation}
\label{subsec:data-repr}

Mind maps edited in our software will be kept in a database (\cref{fig:erd}) which consists of two tables.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The first represents a mind map with a UUID.
	\item The second --- a single `mind node' which has the following fields: \begin{itemize}
		\item UUID,
		\item its mind map's UUID,
		\item some textual content,
		\item parent node UUID,
		\item timestamp of the last modification (provided only by server, this is \emph{not a local time}),
		\item and a flag which says whether there was a merge conflict in the past, which has not yet been taken care of by the user.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Both local database in Android devices (SQLite) and server-side database (PostgreSQL) share the same schema.

\end{figure}

\subsection{XMind import}
\label{subsec:xmind-exchange}

XMind files (`workbooks') are saved as a ZIP archive of mostly \inlinecode{.xml} files, two of which are the most important and are always present. First, \inlinecode{content.xml} stores data and its hierarchy, and the second, \inlinecode{META-INF/manifest.xml} is the list of files included in the archive. An {\em XMind} file could also contain separate \inlinecode{.xml} documents for content and styles, a \inlinecode{.jpg} image file for thumbnails, and directories for related attachments. \cite{XMind:2009:Format}

\todo[inline]{Finish XMind import: write about the recursive import method.}

\subsection{Android--Akka communication}
\label{subsec:android-akka-comm}

Real-time collaboration (along with \emph{offline} synchronization) is by any means the most challenging part of designing and later implementing the system.

\todo[inline]{Fill in Android--Akka communication.}

The fact that a single node remembers only its parent will cause a number of problems with merge conflicts dealing with node deletions, see subtree recreation algorithm in \cref{subsec:subtree-recreation}.

\subsection{Subtree recreation algorithm}
\label{subsec:subtree-recreation}

This algorithm has to be used when given a scenario in which:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item At least two users (Alice and Bob) share a map.
	\item The map gets synchronized on their devices in common state A.
	\item Alice goes offline.
	\item Bob, still online, deletes subtree S (changes state to B).
	\item Alice, still offline edits one of of children nodes in subtree S (changes state to B').
	\item Alice goes online and tries to synchronize.
	\item Server does not know a UUID of the children node, thus cannot naïvely merge B and B'.
	\item Now, subtree S has to be somehow recreated from Alice's version.
\end{enumerate}

\todo[inline]{M., come up with subtree recreation algo.}
