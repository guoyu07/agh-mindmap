\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:impl-intro}

\subsection{Choosing IDE}
\label{subsec:choosing-ide}
We started with setting up a development environment. Since our language of choice is Scala, it was important to find an IDE which provides support for both Android and Scala development and can integrate these two elements. Quickly it turned out that there is no out-of-the-box solution. Three most popular development environments are Ecplise, NetBeans and IntelliJ, and all of them support Scala development. 

After some research and because of previous experience with Android development, we decided to work in IntelliJ IDEA 12 (and we switched to 13 as soon as it was released). We chose this particular solution because it provides seperate module facets for Android and Scala projects\cite{Steingress:2011:AndroidScala}. Also, it seems that it is the most advanced tool when it comes to code assistance. One of its most helpful features is smart code completion for both Scala and Android-specific files\cite{Steingress:2011:AndroidScala}. Also, IntelliJ IDEA offers a great deal of code analysis tools, which help to locate possible bugs, dead code and performance issues. The whole process of compiling a project is speed up by external build - it means that all compilation tasks are run as a process separated from other IDEA processes. Apart from speeding compilation up, it decreases IDE's memory consumption\cite{Fatin:2012:NewWay}. The latest version (13)  has built-in SBT (Simple Build Tool) integration -- this term will be explained in the next section. 

\subsection{Android integration with SBT}
\label{subsec:choosing-ide}
Since, as mentioned, there is no out-of-the-box solution for Android development in Scala, we had to find an SBT plugin which integrates both modules. SBT is an open source build tool for Scala and Android projects similar to Maven or Ant. It is used to invoke Scalac compilator, which compiles the source code to bytecode. But one of the main reasons why it is so popular is that it provides an interactive shell -- REPL, from which one can access all classes of the project. Another is incremental compiling, thanks to this feature only modified files are recompiled. \cite{Fatin:2012:NewWay}. A way to extend SBT's functionality is using one of many available plugins, or writing one. 

At first we used an android sbt plugin written by Walter Chang, Mark Harrah and Jan Berkel, available on github.com as "android-plugin" repository.
