\section{Requirements}
\label{sec:requirements}

Our aim is to create an application compatible with XMind which lets its users create, edit, and display mind maps and delete mind nodes. It shoud also implement importing and exporting maps to XMind format. The most important feature (apart from these, which make it possible to use our Android application) is online and offline collaboration. It should work on most modern Android devices, both smartphones and tablets, as well as support Android starting from API level 10. 

Mind maps should be presented in a clean, structured way. A special algorithm is needed to fulfill this task, because the number and size of child nodes will vary. Nodes need to be positioned around the root node. Every node can have subnodes, which are displayed as a list, and it should be possible to hide or show node's whole subtree by clicking on a special button. Adding a new node can be implemented by placing a plus button on the bottom of parent node. The whole node's body should be clickable and thus a user could enter edit mode.

It should be possible to share the same map between more than one person. Every participant should be able to edit a map (online, but also when the connection is not available) and see others' changes as soon as it is possible. This feature will probably generate a number of problems with data synchronization. Also, it should mark any conflicts in the content of single, atomic node.

As we will concentrate mostly on the \emph{collaborative} aspects of the system (both on-line and off-line), no user privileges will be implemented (although these would be easy to add, considering highly modular and clean organization of code). Thus, any client will be able to modify any existing map.
