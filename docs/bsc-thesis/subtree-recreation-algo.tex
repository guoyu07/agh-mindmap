\subsection{Subtree recreation algorithm}
\label{subsec:subtree-recreation}

This algorithm has to be used when given a scenario in which:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item At least two users (Alice and Bob) share a map.
	\item The map gets synchronized on their devices in common state A.
	\item Alice goes offline.
	\item Bob, still online, deletes subtree S (changes state to B).
	\item Alice, still offline edits one of of children nodes in subtree S (changes state to B').
	\item Alice goes online and tries to synchronize.
	\item Server does not know a UUID of the children node, thus cannot naïvely merge B and B'.
	\item Now, subtree S has to be somehow recreated from Alice's version.
\end{enumerate}

\todo[inline]{\michal{M., come up with subtree recreation algo.}}
