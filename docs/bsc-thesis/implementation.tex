\subsection{No removing of tabs in Android's TabHost}
\label{subsec:problem-tabhost}

\todo[inline]{\michal{M., describe custom removing of tabs.}}

Resolved: \href{https://github.com/michalrus/agh-mindmap/commit/ebe22968dc091f575ab16be0d0051dbfb7f3e434}{ebe22968dc091f575ab16be0d0051dbfb7f3e434}.

All tabs had to be removed and then readded. Also we had to manually use another container for our Fragments.

\subsection{No bidirectional scroll view in Android standard components}
\label{subsec:problem-scrollview}

\todo[inline]{\michal{M., write about custom bidirectional ScrollView.}}
