\section{Planned solution}
\label{sec:plan}

Our application allows its users to edit maps collaboratively, either over the Internet in real time, or offline with later online synchronization. To achieve this, we are going to use Akka.io and Spray.io, an actor system with REST communication model designed for Scala. The whole system consists of two main components:

\begin{itemize}
	\item an Android application running on any number of Android powered devices,
	\item and a cluster of any number of servers running a distributed, highly parallelized Akka actor system with a REST interface.
\end{itemize}

To find out how the system works, see \cref{fig:diagram-components-system}. Basic communication flow is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item any local change introduced by the user within the UI module of the Android application is saved to the local SQLite database and the Synchronizer module is notified,
	\item the Synchronizer will communicate local updates to the http.Updater actor via REST call---\inlinecode{POST /update}---over HTTP,
	\item the Synchronizer will also long-poll the remote updates from http.Poller actor, again, via REST call of \inlinecode{GET /poll/since/\$TIME} (\inlinecode{\$TIME} is a lower bound for a remote to-be-returned update timestamp),
  \item these http.* actors communicate with the MapsSupervisor which forwards their messages to appropriate MindMap actors (there's one such actor for each mind map document),
  \item what is not shown on the diagram is that MindMap actors flush their in-memory data structures to an underlying PostgreSQL database, which allows the system to keep its state in case of a restart).
\end{itemize}
