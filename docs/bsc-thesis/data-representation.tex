\subsection{Data representation}
\label{subsec:data-repr}

Mind maps edited in our software will be kept in a SQL database (\cref{fig:erd}) which consists of two tables.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The first represents a mind map with a UUID.
	\item The second --- a single `mind node' which has the following fields: \begin{itemize}
		\item UUID,
		\item its mind map's UUID,
		\item some textual content,
		\item parent node UUID,
		\item timestamp of the last modification (provided only by server, this is \emph{not a local time}),
		\item and a flag which says whether there was a merge conflict in the past, which has not yet been taken care of by the user.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Both local database in Android devices (SQLite) and server-side database (PostgreSQL) share the same scheme.
