\subsection{XMind import}
\label{subsec:xmind-exchange}

XMind files (`workbooks') are saved as a ZIP archive of mostly \inlinecode{.xml} files, two of which are the most important and are always present. First, \inlinecode{content.xml} stores data and its hierarchy, and the second, \inlinecode{META-INF/manifest.xml} is the list of files included in the archive. An {\em XMind} file could also contain separate \inlinecode{.xml} documents for content and styles, a \inlinecode{.jpg} image file for thumbnails, and directories for related attachments. \cite{XMind:2009:Format}

\todo[inline]{\michal{M./K., finish XMind import: write about the recursive import method.}}
